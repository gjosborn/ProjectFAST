*A Django webapp that completes the basic functions of manual gunnery*

One of the most formative experiences of a youn artilleryman's career is completing the manual gunnery
unit during Field Artillery Basic Officer Leader's Course. This unit culminates in the dreaded "safety test"
This test measures whether you have a deep enough understanding of the math and physics of artillery to safely
operate on a gunline or in a Fire Direction Center.

These tests are verified by hand or in some cases through sophisticated excel workbooks that double check the
the calculations made. However, this limits the amount of practice students may get since they are limited to
those released by their instructors and the creation of the exams and study materials is a time consuming process.

What if students were able to login to a webapp, select what type of safety problems they would like assistance
with and have example safety worksheets generated for them to complete. What if instructors could login and generate
their safety exams from their account, generating a different exam for each student to prevent cheating.

That is what I aim to accomplish in this webapp, create a simpler process for one of the more arduous processes
during the course, lightening the load on instructors, and creating more adept field artillerymen and women.
